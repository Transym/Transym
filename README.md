Transym Computer Services is a leading provider of highly accurate and reliable optical character recognition (OCR) software for developers and integrators. Our engine (TOCR) has been used by thousands of companies around the world to bring consistency and precision to their own in-house and commercial solutions.

We’re constantly pushing ourselves to create better and more innovative software – whether by expanding TOCR’s range of recognised European languages, or enhancing its ability to read almost obliterated text.

Our products are developed with integration in mind – and in a field where many of the leading optical character recognition products can be unreliable, we’re proud to offer a truly scalable, accurate solution.
